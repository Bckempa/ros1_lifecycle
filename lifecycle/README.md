# Lifecycle

Node Lifecycle is a simple framework for life-cycle for ROS nodes to have a greater control over the state of ROS system. This project is an effort to bring the [ROS2Design](http://design.ros2.org/articles/node_lifecycle.html) for the ROS 1. The framework provides abstract classes for implementing Life-cycle mechanism to application nodes.  See [**docs/Managed_nodes.pdf**](docs/Managed_nodes.pdf) for a comprehensive description of the core concepts of Node life-cycle. This document has been copied from [http://design.ros2.org/articles/node_lifecycle.html] in May 2016.
