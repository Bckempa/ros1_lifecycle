# Lifecycle_python

Node Life-cycle is a simple framework for life-cycle for ROS nodes to have a greater control over the state of ROS system. This project is an effort to bring the [ROS2Design](http://design.ros2.org/articles/node_lifecycle.html) for the ROS 1.


Lifecycle_python is similar to Lifecycle except that it is implemented in python.
